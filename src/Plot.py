        @brief      Runs main.py file on the nucleo and collects data.     
        @details    This plot function needs to command the nucleo to restart and run main.py. Once the Nucleo
                    is running it's main file and outputting data, the open serial port uses readline to detect
                    return carriages. To make our program function most reliably, we had the main.py file output
                    a 111 to allow us to know when to start taking data.
